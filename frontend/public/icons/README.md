# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the PWA icons for the application.

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons

You can use any of these methods:

### Option 1: Online Icon Generator

- Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- Upload your logo/image
- Download the generated icons

### Option 2: Manual Creation

- Create a 512x512px image with your logo
- Save as `icon-512.png`
- Resize to 192x192px and save as `icon-192.png`

## Temporary Placeholder

Until you add your icons, the PWA will still work but won't have custom icons when installed on mobile devices.

You can use a simple colored square as a placeholder:

- Background color: #0d6efd (Bootstrap primary blue)
